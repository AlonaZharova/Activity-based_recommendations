## Summary 

The energy consumption of private households amounts to approximately 30% of the total global
energy consumption, causing a large share of the CO2 emissions through energy production. An
intelligent demand response via load shifting increases the energy efficiency of residential buildings
by nudging residents to change their energy consumption behavior. This paper introduces an activity
prediction-based framework for the utility-based context-aware multi-agent recommendation system
that generates an activity shifting schedule for a 24-hour time horizon to either focus on CO2
emissions or energy costs savings. In particular, we design and implement an Activity Agent that uses
hourly energy consumption data. It does not require further sensorial data or activity labels which
reduces implementation costs and the need for extensive user input. Moreover, the system enhances
the utility option of saving energy costs by saving CO2 emissions and provides the possibility to
focus on both dimensions. The empirical results show that while setting the focus on CO2 emissions
savings, the system provides an average of 12% of emissions savings and 7% of cost savings. When
setting the focus on energy costs savings, 20% of energy costs and 6% of emissions savings are
possible for the studied households in case of accepting of all recommendations. Recommending
an activity schedule, the system uses the same terms residents describe their domestic life with.
Therefore, recommendations can be more easily integrated into daily life supporting the acceptance
of the system in a long-term perspective.
